# Padelful filters

I wanted to buy a padel racket as a birthday gift for my father, but the [Padelful](https://www.padelful.com/en/rackets) website lacked the filtering options I needed. 

To solve this, I [scraped their data](https://github.com/afonsobspinto/padelful-filters/blob/main/rackets.json) and built an API that enables custom filtering. 

With this API, I can now effortlessly find the perfect padel racket for my dad based on attributes like **power, control, rebound, maneuverability, sweet spot, and overall rating**. 

Happy birthday Dad!
